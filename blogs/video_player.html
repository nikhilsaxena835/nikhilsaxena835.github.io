      <h2>What is inside a media file?</h2>
      <p>
        A media file is also called a container. MP4, AVI, MP3 etc are all containers. They contain tracks,
        like video tracks, audio tracks and some metadata. A "stream" or a "track" is just a succession
        of data elements made available over time. The data element of a stream is called a frame. <br>

        One of the things the metadata tells is 
        the codec to use. A video is essentially a "stream" of images. And how these images are encoded (and how to
        decode them) is said by the codec. Codec (COded and DECoded) is an algorithm using which the stream was 
        initially encoded.
